<h3>Interviews - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h3>
</div>

    
    
    
    <div class="row justify-content-center readable">
          <p>Looking for a job sucks big time. A couple of months ago, I was going through interview after interview like a wrecking ball blasting through concrete. I didn't actually destroy any buildings in the process although I may have burned a couple bridges along the way. We laughed, we cried, it was roller coaster of emotions and then I got a job.</p>

<p>Here's a blow-by-blow review of the interviews I went through. I've reflected on each interview and coupled each with recommendations for you if you're going through a similar interview process.</p>

<p>My help will be most relevant to those working in a similar field to my own (software engineering) so your mileage may vary.</p>

<h1 id="interview-1">Interview 1</h1>

<p>As soon as I started looking for work, a coworker from my previous job reached out to me asking me if I was interested in new opportunities. He put me in contact through email directly to the CEO of a company that he wasn't working for according to his CV. After looking into the company, I wasn't ecstatic about working there because it was a bit too similar to the kind of work I had been doing previously but I wasn't completely against it either.</p>

<p>I was hoping to go to the interview, talk to the people there to get a better idea about the company and the kind of work I would be doing there. My work experience seemed like a perfect fit for the kind of people they would be looking for so I was expecting a decent interview.</p>

<p>â€¦ I couldn't have been more wrong.</p>

<p>In my career, I have never had an interview where interviewers gave me no meaningful details about the work I would be doing. I tried to pry the information out gently but unfortunately they weren't interested in making me interested.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good interview is a conversation, a solid back and forth between the two parties ensuring that both parties can, if desired, come to a long term decision that's profitable for everyone involved. If possible, try to steer the interview back into a conversation whenever possible and appropriate: ask as many questions as you answer or more and explain your thought process fully when solving problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lying as an interviewee isn't beneficial because the truth comes out eventually. That's true for the interviewers as well however often they will massage the truth to their benefit, and hope that you forget by the time you've signed the contract. Human resources people will often call you and tell you sweet nothings, if it's not on paper it means nothing and you'll have a hard time getting them to write anything on paper other than their copy/pasted contract.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This interview was a waste of time for both parties. When I received the call informing me that the company wasn't making an offer I inquired about why. Unfortunately, I didn't receive an answer that made much sense.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interviewers have never taken the time to give me constructive feedback on why they didn't make me an offer. I suggest being attentive before, during and after an interview to understand why an interview might have gone well, badly or somewhere in between. Your interviewers stop thinking about you the moment they make their decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="interview-2">Interview 2</h1>

<p>I contacted one of my professional contacts who works for a company I was interested in. I applied for two positions at the company. My contact escalated my case and got me an interview within a few days.</p>

<p>I cleaned myself up, shaved, cut my hair and headed out the door with a stride in my step.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even though most jobs don't require you to look impeccable at all times, first impressions are important and as such you should make an effort to look as sharp as possible for interviews. Also, remember to dress appropriately, you probably shouldn't wear a tuxedo although customs can differ greatly between different companies and different countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I arrived around fifteen minutes early. I notified the receptionist of my interview and sat down. I double checked my look, I closed my eyes and then I performed some deep breathing exercises to put my mind at ease.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most jobs are stressful to some degree, life can sometimes be stressful, practicing meditation at any level is great no matter what you do or who you are and I highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideally I would have opened my eyes before my interviewers found me. With my eyes closed I could have come off as being stressed or not confident even though I was.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interviews have much more to do with the way you present yourself and how agreeable you are than with your technical skills or knowledge you have. Once you get the job, that's when your skills are really put to the test. Most people would rather work with someone who is nice to be around but less competent than a genius who is an complete asshole.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, first impressions are important, so make it count. You don't want your interviewer(s) to decide that you're not fit for the position the first time they lay eyes on you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I greeted them with a handshake and introduced myself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write down your interviewers names to remember them and to give you a point of contact for a follow up if needed after the interview. After getting the job, speaking to the people who interviewed you is a good way of meeting your coworkers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As one interviewer, I'll call him interviewer A, opened the door to the interview room, he told me that he wouldn't be talking much because he wasn't interested in me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn't matter what you say or do, some people are never going to hire you no matter how good your interview goes because they've looked at your CV and your face and decided that they're not interested. As mentioned above, looking your best for an interview is important. Making a good looking CV is key because the person who set up your interview might not be the person who's interviewing you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We sat down and I noticed that interviewer B looked like they wanted to jump out of the window.</p>

<p>So here I am, doing an interview where one of my interviewers isn't planning on hiring me no matter what I say and another is having a really bad day.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>There's not much I could have done to salvage this situation although I tried my best by being confident in my abilities and answering any questions as best I could.</p>

<p>I received an email the next day informing me that neither person was interested in me. This time, they gave me a reason as to why although it was complete nonsense.</p>

<p>They stated that I lacked sufficient knowledge of C++. I have multiple large C++ projects completed in university and in the workplace. I answered all the C++ questions perfectly except the question "Why is multiple inheritance in C++ frowned upon?" I answered because it can make the code hard to understand. The answer they must have been expecting was the "Diamond Problem" which had slipped my mind at the time.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>Let's take a step back. This company hires non-software engineers (electrical, aerospace, etc.) with no experience writing good C++ code by the truckload and they're telling me that I can't write C++ code and thus they can't hire me?</p>

<p>Total BS.</p>

<p>They have to give a reason because that's in their policies because they don't want to get sued for dismissing people for reasons other than their qualifications (looks, race, gender, etc.) even though it happens all the time and everyone knows it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After every interview think about how you can improve the first impression you give by making modifications to your CV. One of my mistakes for this interview was that I had removed a section featuring my many notable school and personal projects. This made it harder for me to convince my two interviewers that my C++ capabilities were on point. You could go so far as to build a CV for each job you apply for. After a couple years of experience, you'll have to pick and choose the most relevant aspects of yourself that you want to present first.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should make your CV fit on one page no matter what. Feel free to link to a longer form CV if you have a lot of experience but the likelihood of someone reading past the first page of a CV is not very high unless you're already in the interview room at which point the CV doesn't really matter anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Students, I recommend you favor education programs (university or otherwise) which provide you with real work experience. It is invaluable. You'll discover your likes and dislikes, you'll make professional contacts in whatever industry you're working in (maybe several others), you'll learn by osmosis through working with more experienced coworkers. Also, you'll be able to fill out your CV with real experience which interviewers like to see.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="interview-3">Interview 3</h1>

<p>I spoke on the phone to a recruiter from HR from one company. At some point he stated that my French wasn't good enough (I went to French school from the ages of around 6 to 17 years old, another year in my post graduate studies and I have multiple years of experience working solely in French).</p>

<p>I've been told by native French speakers that I'm perfectly bilingual. I don't know about that but I can communicate anything I need to communicate well. Given that a lot of people are bilingual, if I'm speaking French and I'm unsure of to express an idea I'm able use English words when I feel like it and everybody gets it.</p>

<p>I got an email from the recruiter I spoke to saying that the company wasn't interested in continuing the recruitment process with me. I replied back nicely asking the reasons why. I never got an answer.</p>

<h1 id="interview-4">Interview 4</h1>

<p>Another company requested that I do an online programming test as the first step of the recruitment process. I hadn't done one of those in a couple years. I was rusty and I didn't perform well on it.</p>

<p>I over engineered a solution that would have taken me more time to implement than the hour and a half I had to take the test. Our dog, who rarely barks, was barking non-stop which wasn't helping me concentrate.</p>

<p>My results didn't impress the company and they weren't interested in continuing the interview process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each company's interview process is going to be different. When preparing for interviews speak to others in a similar field to yours and to get an idea of what to expect and prepare accordingly. Shortly after failing this test I spent a couple days building a framework for solving problems on projecteuler.net with automated test generation and I used it to solve around thirty problems that I had never solved before. I wrote two similar frameworks: one in Python, a language I know very well, and one in Go, a language I didn't know.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="final-interview-no-i-didnt-die">Final Interview (no I didn't die)</h1>

<p>I was undergoing the interview process for three companies. The company I was most interested in gave me an offer that I couldn't refuse and so I accepted it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notice that you only need to receive a single offer, the fact that a couple other companies don't think you were a good fit doesn't matter. Ideally the company you were most interested in is one of the ones that makes you an offer. Fingers crossed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their interview process was the most reasonable and effective (at least from my perspective). I was able to meet many of my future coworkers who asked me a good mix of questions about the work I've done in the past and technical questions.</p>

<p>I've been working at my new job for a couple months now and it's been going well.</p>

<p>So, we've learned that looking for a job does suck big time. However, looking for a relationship sucks even bigger time. But that's a story for another day.</p>
