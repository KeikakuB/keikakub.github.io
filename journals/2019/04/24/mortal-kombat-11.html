                <p>I'm currently working on finishing up my personal website (the one you're currently on, I should probably put a "work-in-progress" sign upâ€¦). Work has been going well, I had done most of the 'setting everything up' a year and a half ago before I was employed by Framestore VR. I was quite busy after that with various things and this project sadly fell to the wayside.</p>

<p>I left Framestore recently to pursue other opportunities and have found myself with some free time to relax while I am between jobs as well as reviving this website by updating it with all the information on the projects I've worked on (think of as an expanded CV) as well as a space for my writing on video games and hopefully other writing as well.</p>

<p>Overall the work has been going according to plan, I was expecting to spend the whole day working on on the website yesterday however Mortal Kombat 11's story mode and juicy gameplay got in the way.</p>

<p>After a quick taste of the various modes that the game offers, I started up the story mode, not really knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by extremely campy writing and delivery coupled with amazingly choreographed fight scenes. The cheesy writing meshes well with the absurd events that occur in the story.</p>

<p>I've always been interested in competitive fighting games. What I love most in fighting games is trying to get into my opponent's head, predict what they are trying to do and countering it which is usually called "mind" games or Yomi within the community.</p>

<p>I'm less interested in games that require players to memorize lists of buttons to press or to hit buttons with extremely precise timings for them to be able to compete at a level where the mind games take over as the deciding factor which determines the player that'll win.</p>

<p>Ever since I played Super Street Fighter II Turbo Remix on the Xbox 360, I've been searching for the "One". The fighting game that'll stick with me, that I'll fall in love with.</p>

<p>The closest I've come to was with Killer Instinct. I played it religiously for a couple months when the PC version released at the end of 2017. KI is easy to pick up and play, it has a great tutorial system for teaching new players, it plays well on a controller (no arcade stick needed), it's combo assist system allows new players to perform combos easily and the combo breaker system allows for a constant back and forth between players even when one player is being comboed by the other.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I didn't stick with the game. I didn't enjoy playing as any of the thirty plus characters in the game. I enjoyed the mechanics of the game but it was hard to stay invested in the game I didn't really connect with any of the characters.</p>

<p>My first impression of Mortal Kombat 11, as a person who has barely touched any of the previous Mortal Kombat games, is a positive one so far and I'm excited to continue exploring it.</p>

<p>One of the main complaints that has been spreading around the community about the game has been about the microtransactions (in the context of video games, meaning small purchases that provide the player some kind of in-game benefit, a new hat for their character, etc.) present in the game.</p>

<p>Although I haven't delved deep enough in the game to present an informed opinion on the extent to which they are anti-consumer, if at all, but as a software engineer with three years of experience in the video game industry as well as an avid and informed gamer I'm somewhat versed in the costs and struggles of developing a video game in today's market.</p>

<p>Microtransactions have become more and more ubiquitous in modern AAA video games as a way of increasing profits as the costs for developing AAA games have continued rising to meet the ever growing expectations of players.</p>

<p>Digital distribution systems like Steam have contributed to this issue by being able to offer games at drastically reduced costs to consumers due to their digital nature, further decreasing the perceived value and cost of a AAA game in the eyes of the consumer for better or worse.</p>

<p>Microtransactions are not going away anytime soon, they are going to become more and more prevalent in AAA games to offset the costs associated with developing them.</p>

<p>I think that certain microtransaction practices are extremely predatory and should definitely be regulated in some fashion, for example forcing companies to reveal the odds of receiving each item from a "loot box". While other microtransaction economies can be relatively benign.</p>

<p>As a community, we should try and educate others (especially those of us who are more vulnerable to these tactics such as children, individuals suffering from obsessive compulsive disorders, etc.), about the psychology behind microtransacitions (topics such as the Skinner Box, fake currency/point systems which make it harder for the player to understand the real cost of the microtransaction they're paying for, etc.) to avoid them falling into the trap set by predatory microtransaction systems in games.</p>

<p>I'm not currently in a position where I can analyze how microtransactions are used in Mortal Kombat 11 and their impact on the experience however I can say that you can purchase the game, pick any character you want (other than Shao Khan who is a pre-order bonus but that's a story for another day) and play against other players online on a level playing field no matter how big their wallet is.</p>

<p>Which sadly can't be taken for granted anymore.</p>
