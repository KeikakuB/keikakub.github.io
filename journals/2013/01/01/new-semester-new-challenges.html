          <p>Today was the first day of my second semester at McGill.</p>

<p>I'm happy with most of my profs. That's good because if my teachers aren't motivating and/or interesting then it makes it harder for me to absorb the material.</p>

<p>The course material that we'll be covering in all my classes is intriguing to me. I would have been surprised if this not the case because I like to learn in general. There is almost nothing I wouldn't want to learn about.</p>

<p>As you may know, I'm studying for a Software Engineering (Honors) degree in the faculty of Computer Science. Last semester, I only had one computer science class, this semester I have four. Ya, I know right. This semester is going to be quite computer science heavy.</p>

<p>I'm taking five courses for a total of 15 credits. I'll talk a little about each and my thoughts on them so far.</p>

<h1 id="chem-180-world-of-chemistry-environment">CHEM 180 World of Chemistry: Environment</h1>

<p>A chemistry class? Wut? I won't lie, I've always enjoyed chemistry. Although, I wouldn't consider this course to be a particularly chemistry-heavy course (no labs).</p>

<p>From what I can tell, we'll be learning about chemistry in the world around us. Some of the many subjects we'll be covering are environmental toxins, water pollution, natural resources and energy.</p>

<p>Those are some important things to learn about (especially for our generation), not only for seeming smart at the dinner table but also for being more aware of the aspects of the world that are often invisible to us.</p>

<h1 id="comp-206-introduction-to-software-systems">COMP 206 Introduction to Software Systems</h1>

<p>Software systems? What are those? Well, if you are to believe my prof then everyone has a different definition for software systems, or systems software if you prefer. So who knows really?</p>

<p>But, from what both profs (Two profs! Woh, I've never had that before!) said, I believe we'll be learning C (syntax, use, makefiles, etc.), Unix/Linux (OS and shell commands) and Python (which I already know :[ ).</p>

<p>I've tried C but it never grabbed me like the other languages I've used. It is one of the most popular and most used languages of all time though, soâ¦ I'll suck it up, give it another shot and eventually I'll be able to add another tool to my ever-growing programming toolbox.</p>

<h1 id="comp-251-algorithms-and-data-structures">COMP 251 Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>

<p>Algorithms and Data Structures? Sounds fun. It's the successor to the COMP 250 Intro to Programming class I took last semester. We covered the basic data structures and the algorithms associated to them (from the linked list to the hash map ending with the graph).</p>

<p>COMP 251 seems to be a continuation of COMP 250 but with a heavier focus on algorithms and their analysis (Big-Oh).</p>

<p>Algorithms and data structures form the basis of all non-trivial programming tasks. Learning about them both will allow me to use tried-and-tested algorithms to solve difficult problems and will help me eventually build my own.</p>

<h1 id="comp-302-programming-languages-and-paradigms">COMP 302 Programming Languages and Paradigms</h1>

<p>Wow! Sounds cool! Yup, we'll be learning about functional programming and types. Although I've dabbled in functional programming (Erlang, Scala, technically Python but not really), I don't consider myself anything other than a beginner.</p>

<p>I'm quite happy to be given the chance to learn about the functional programming paradigm in more detail because it has always intrigued me. Formally learning about types is icing on the cake.</p>

<h1 id="comp-273-introduction-to-computer-systems">COMP 273 Introduction to Computer Systems</h1>

<p>I haven't had my COMP 273 class yet. From what I've heard though, I know that we'll be learning about the hardware in a computer rather than the software.</p>

<p>I have no clue how a computer works under the hood and that seems like something I should know. I have high hopes for this class. We'll seeâ¦ Tomorrow.</p>
