                <p>I've been playing video games for a long time. When I was a kid, I remember  playing Final Fantasy X on the Playstation 2. When I arrived in the flooded ruins of Zanarkand, and heard the melancholic sounds of a piano playing in the distance, I felt warm inside.</p>

<p>It made me feel small in a big world. It took me out of my seat and transported me thousands of miles away, to a time and place unlike my own which I could not even begin to understand.</p>

<p>I've read hundreds of books, I've played hundreds of games, I've watched hundreds of movies but I can count on one hand the number of times I've been sucked into a world in which I could truly forget who I am, where I am and begin to live as someone else for a short time.</p>

<p>The Walking Dead is an episodic Adventure Horror game developed by Telltale Games based on the comic book series by Robert Kirkman. Like most, I first came into contact with The Walking Dead not through the comic books but through the popular AMC television series by the same name.</p>

<p>For those who've never watched, read or played any of the works based on The Walking Dead, it follows a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse in their quest for survival.</p>

<p>Its main strength is its focus on presenting the tense social interactions between the survivors. This is perhaps due to its origin as a comic book, a medium in which action-heavy storylines don't work as well as in film or tv.</p>

<p>In The Walking Dead video game, you become Lee Everett, a 38 year-old history professor and convicted killer. The story begins when you are being transported in a police patrol car to prison. The policeman hits a zombie on the highway and the car goes flying into a ditch.</p>

<p>Two days later, you wake up and find yourself surrounded by zombies (or walkers). Shortly after, you meet Clementine, an 8 year-old girl having survived on her own for the past few days.</p>

<p>As you and Clementine venture out into the zombie infested world, you meet others, you form a group and you go through a lot together. Suffice to say that not everyone lasts to the end.</p>

<p>Every time, I lost someone because of the walkers, the unfriendly but living, one of our own or even by my own hand, I felt a profound sense of loss unlike anything I've ever experienced in my life.</p>

<p>Throughout, The Walking Dead was emotionally draining and difficult to play. By the end, The Walking Dead metaphorically threw me off an emotional cliff and allowed me to experience the inexperiencable. I hope it does the same for you.</p>
