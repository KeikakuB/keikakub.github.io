          <p>Violent video games. Verdict: Good or bad? I don't know for sure but I do know that a lot of people (of all ages) play them. I'm an avid believer in the potential for good games to make us better people, but I'm also aware that there aren't a lot of video games on the market worth playing.</p>

<p>Violence is ubiquitous in today's media whether it's in games, tv or movies. Violence sells but is virtual violence good for us? As Paracelsus, a German-Swiss Renaissance physician and alchemist, would say "The dose makes the poison".</p>

<p>Perhaps, consuming violent media in moderation is beneficial to us? It allows players to experience catharsis (emotional release), expelling their violent emotions from within themselves in a safe and healthy manner.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be surprising that we seem to like immersing ourselves in violence to such an extent, considering that for 95% of humanity's existence, we lived as hunter-gatherers who's survival depended primarily on our violent natures. Those who weren't good killers perished, those who were survived and passed on their genes to the next generation. Obviously, this is an over-simplification of the process of natural selection but it isn't too far from reality.</p>

<p>We as humans were built to kill, but, in today's society, the urge to commit violent acts against others is no longer beneficial to our well-being and survival. In order to live a content life, our primal instincts need to be satisfied without causing harm to others. Violent video games provide us with a means for subduing the beast contained within each and every one of us.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed by now, Far Cry 3 is a violent video game. It is an FPS featuring a group of American guys and gals trapped in the densely forested and tropical Rook Island after being intercepted by a group of local slave-traders.</p>

<p>You play as Jason Brody who begins as a weak and clueless blank slate who's constantly tormented by the loss of his brother at the hands of Vas, the leader of the slave-traders. Over the course of your adventure, Jason befriends the Rakyat, a local resistance fighting against Vas's goons, and evolves into a powerful and independent fighter channeling the essence of a mythical warrior worshiped by the Rakyat.</p>

<p>Far Cry 3 follows in the footsteps of its previous installments by unleashing the player into a living and breathing open-world. What do you do in this world? Well, for the most part you shoot things in the face. And I won't lie, the action in Far Cry 3 is a total blast. If you like shooters then, by all means, stop reading and pick up a copy of the game right away.</p>

<p>For those who need a little more convincing, Far Cry 3 is the first shooter I've played in a long time which has had an intriguing and well-told story. The voice-acting, the facial animation, the execution of its scenes (especially the dream and drug sequences) are all phenomenal.</p>

<p>Today, every FPS worth talking about has perfected its shooting. What makes one triple-A FPS better than another is not its shooting but everything else. Far Cry 3 does everything well and is well worth playing.</p>
