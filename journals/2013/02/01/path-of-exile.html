<h3>Path of Exile</h3>
</div>

    
    
    
    <div class="row justify-content-center readable">
          <p>For those who've played and enjoyed Diablo games, Path of Exile represents an evolution and much-needed revamping of action-rpg genre. Suffice to say, that most people who played Diablo III like me who've followed the series over the years were disappointed by the game, mostly due to how it turned into a virtual currency collection fest.</p>

<p>For example, a close friend of mine spent dozens of hours buying low and selling high on the Diablo III marketplace. In Diablo III, players could exchange real money for fake items or fake items for real money, that's what he did. He "played" the game a total of around 120h, spending most of his time browsing through pages and pages of items on the marketplace, looking for deals. He didn't make any amount of real money worth mentioning, but this lead me to ask myself, "When does a game stop being a game and becomes a job?"</p>

<p>In short, they took a series and turned it into another MMO. The mixing of the MMO style auction house and the old-school gameplay came together in an awkward way that some people, including me, did not enjoy.</p>

<p>So, if you were disappointed by World of Diablocraft and are looking for an action-rpg in the vein of Diablo and Diablo II then Path of Exile should be right up your alley. It's a free to play game, so there's nothing stopping you from downloading the game right now and trying it out. The developers of the game use micro transactions to finance the game but right now, they are non-invasive and don't give players who spend money an unfair advantage over those who don't.</p>

<p>Path of Exile is very interesting. Mobs don't drop currency. In fact, there is no currency. Yes, you read me right. No cash, no gold, no merchandising virtual loot for virtual cash. This absence of hard cash greatly shifts the focus of the game from collecting money to collecting awesome items. This might seem like a small thing but sometimes the smallest changes can bring the biggest improvements in a system.</p>

<p>Path of Exile encourages players to cooperate with each other, more so than other games of its ilk due to the fact that there is no auction house. To obtain items, players must play the game and barter with individual players rather than with the vast and impersonal auction house. Items of no use to your character, like a bow for a melee-oriented fighter, can be traded with other players so that you both benefit.</p>

<p>Path of Exile allows for a quasi-infinite array of character builds. This is due to its tremendously complex and free-form passive skill tree and the fact that a character's active abilities don't come from his class but rather from the various gems socketed in his equipment. Through these various systems, Path of Exile gives the player ultimate freedom in creating the character they wish to create. Keeping in mind that character creation/evolution over time is the most important part of any RPG, Path of Exile is a must-play.</p>
