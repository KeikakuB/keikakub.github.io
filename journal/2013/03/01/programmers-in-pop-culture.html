                <p>Most people have absolutely no clue about programming at all. They know nothing, zilch, nada, nil, null. Times are changing and young kids are being introduced to programming more and more but for the most part, people are unaware of what programmers do in general.</p>

<p>Well, that's not entirely true. Most people have at least seen programmers portrayed in popular culture. Programmers in popular culture generally follow two main archetypes: the Programming God and the Insecure Guy. I'll talk about the Programming God in this post and perhaps I'll cover the Insecure Guy in another.</p>

<p>The Programming God is an all-powerful programming nerd who hacks into highly secure computer networks by writing two lines of code, causes nuclear explosions millions of miles away at the push of button and brings entire governments to their knees using an Etch-A-Sketch.</p>

<p>I love movies and I don't mind if the movie industry exaggerates in their films, fiction is fiction after all. Technically speaking, all the extraordinary acts mentioned above (well maybe not the Etch-A-Sketch one) could be possible. That's not the issue at all.</p>

<p>I have an issue with the fact that these programming gods (who are always played by guys unfortunately) make programming look easy. Too easy in fact. Guess what? I, or any other programmer will tell you, that programming is not easy. It's hard, hard, hard, really hard.</p>

<p>Now let's imagine, that the movie industry churned out a movie in which a fierce programmer, armed only with an Etch-A-Sketch, manages to single-handedly bring down a government. Chances are that the programmer turned a couple knobs and voila. Evil people died and good people were saved. Yadadda. Cool story.</p>

<p>Butâ€¦ If this movie was real, would you have wondered or cared about what happened before all that badass American Save-The-World action? Well, let me put it this way, the programmer responsible for all the coding that went into the awesomely named Etch-A-Sketch Government Killer 3000 worked his ass off. He failed time and time again.</p>

<p>Every waking moment of his existence was spent slaving away at his computer trying to squeeze out every remaining drop of functionality from the dead weight that is working with an Etch-A-Sketch.</p>

<p>It takes an infinite amount of patience and an infinite amount of time to write complex software. Everything, excluding the trivial, a programmer creates is imperfect and so, a piece of software is never 'done' or 'finished'.</p>

<p>All in all, Programmers in movies inaccurately represent real world programmers. Next time you see a movie portraying a programmer typing on a keyboard for about five seconds and instantly curing all known and unknown diseases, you'll be able to tell your friends how hard programming in the real world is.</p>
