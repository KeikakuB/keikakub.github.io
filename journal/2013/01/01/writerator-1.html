                <p>Work on Writerator began on the 3rd of December, three days before my Linear Algebra final. I had just finished writing an analysis of evil personified in Paradise Lost by John Milton for my Intro to English Literature course.</p>

<p>I had written three essays for this class in the span of two weeks, my mind was overflowing with words and all I could think of was literature, literature and more literature.</p>

<p>I was looking for something to program. For me, trying to find something interesting to work on is hardest part of programming (and writing for that matter).</p>

<p>A programmer with free time is like a painter standing in front of an empty canvas or a writer staring at a blank page. Programmers, painters and writers all must face the vast creative expanse and its infinite potential when starting a new project.</p>

<p>It's not surprising that for most, if not all, people, choosing to work on a specific subject or problem is the most difficult part of working on something creatively.</p>

<p>What I've learned is that waiting for the "Greatest Idea Ever" to fall into your lap is a big mistake. My advice is to pick a subject you enjoy or a problem you'd like to solve and get straight to work. Don't be fussy, don't nitpick, just do.</p>

<p>After you make that choice, you'll soon realize that it's where you go from there that's really important. Even if what you obtain in the end, whether it's a short story, an Iphone app or a sculpture, is not exactly what you expected, you will have learned much through your experience.</p>

<p>Afterward you'll be able to look back on your work and ask yourself, "What can I do better next time?" Think about what you did right and what you did wrong and you won't make those same mistakes ever again.</p>

<p>After all, the only way to become an expert in your field is to fail over and over again until you've made so many mistakes that your work in comparison to others is perfect.</p>

<p>In the past couple of years, improvement has become an integral part of my life. I'm not sure why, but perhaps all those years of playing RPGs like Final-Fantasy have had a (many?) positive effect on my psyche. I've found myself with this drive to learn as much as I can from my experiences and the world around me in order to become a better and more knowledgeable person (to level up so to speak).</p>

<p>This is why I'm an advocate of diving head-first (and getting your metaphorical hair wet in the process) into the world. It might not surprise you that one of my goals for the future is to become the best programmer I can be. One way I will achieve this goal is by diving head-first into projects without fussing over the details and just getting to work.</p>

<p>And so, back to my Intro to English class. For days and days, I was slaving away at writing these essays and all I could think of wasÂ WellÂ Writing essays.</p>

<p>Faced with an infinite number of possibilities, I jumped at the first project idea that came to my mind. And so this is how I decided that I would make a tool to help people analyze texts. I gave it a name and started to work. Simple as that.</p>
